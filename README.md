## assignment

Most of this project relevant codes and outputs are inside the `assignment` folder. There we have the `final-project_files/figure-markdown_github` storing the figures information, automatically generated by rendering the `final-project.Rmd` file. The `final-project.Rmd` also produces the `final-project.md` output by downloading, cleaning, processing and plotting the relevant data. `final-project.md` contains the all the code, the write-up of the project and the plots. Finally, `functions.R` is an auxiliary R script, used as a repositery for all the customs functions used for this project and also some general object definitions, such as directories paths, unit conversions and CRS informations. `final-project-concise-version.Rmd` creates a more concise version of the report `final-project-concise-version.pdf` containing just the write-up and the plots

This folder contains the inspirational graphs in png format taken from [Rosa et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01901.x) and [Assunção et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.04.022).


### Common files

- `README.md` this file, a general overview of the repository in markdown format.  
- `.gitignore`  ignore common file types we don't want to accidentally commit to GitHub. Most projects should use this.
- `proposal.md` describes the general guidelines of this project, including a brief description of the goal, data, questions, skills and references.

### Infrastructure for Testing

- `.travis.yml`: A configuration file for automatically running [continuous integration](https://travis-ci.com) checks to verify reproducibility of all `.Rmd` notebooks in the repo.  If all `.Rmd` notebooks can render successfully, the "Build Status" badge above will be green (`build success`), otherwise it will be red (`build failure`).  
- `DESCRIPTION` a metadata file for the repository, based on the R package standard. It's main purpose here is as a place to list any additional R packages/libraries needed for any of the `.Rmd` files to run.
- `tests/render_rmds.R` an R script that is run to execute the above described tests, rendering all `.Rmd` notebooks.
